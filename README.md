# Mission: Update Possible ðŸš—âš¡

## The Challenge
Modern vehicles arenâ€™t just engines and wheels anymore â€” theyâ€™re powerful, software-driven platforms with dozens of interconnected ECUs, sensors, and services. But delivering secure, reliable Over-the-Air (OTA) updates at scale? Thatâ€™s still a big challenge. Update Possible invites you to take on one of the hottest technical problems in the software-defined vehicle world: designing an open, end-to-end OTA update system using cutting-edge tools like Eclipse Symphony, uProtocol, and in-vehicle orchestrators such as Ankaios and Muto.

## Your mission:
* Build a working prototype that pushes updates from a cloud orchestrator to simulated vehicles.
* Leverage open technologies to coordinate, deliver, and verify updates.
* Tackle advanced scenarios like multi-site rollouts, rollback on failure, and first-time provisioning.

This challenge is inspired by real-world regulations like UN R155 and R156, which demand secure, traceable, and auditable software update processes â€” especially for commercial and industrial fleets.
Weâ€™ll provide starter templates, simulated agents, and reference uServices to get you moving fast. Whether youâ€™re a cloud-native developer, embedded engineer, or systems architect, this is your chance to
Work hands-on with open automotive tech

## OTA Updates for ECUs

This  "HPC" variant of the challnge invites you to use Eclipse Symphony, Eclipse Ankaios and Eclipse uProtocol.  

## OTA Updates for Robots

This  "ROS" variant of the challenge invites you to use Eclipse Symphony, Eclipse Muto and Eclipse uProtocol.  

### OTA with Eclipse Ankaios

To run the OTA variant with the Eclipse Ankaios embedded software orchestrator, please follow the instructions of the [README.md](./ankaios/README.md) inside the `ankaios` folder.
