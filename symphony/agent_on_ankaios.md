# Set Up a Symphony Agent via Ankaios

Symphony supports an optional remote agent, which extends Symhony's state seeking to a separate process or network from the Symphony management plane. For example, you can have Symphony management plane running in a headquater office, and remote agents installed on trucks on the road. The agents communicate with the management plane over a MQTT broker. In this challenge, you have the option of using Eclipse Ankaios to deploy your Symphony agent, as explained in the folloiwng steps.
